## Introduction

### The problem addressed by boost::real
Several times, when dealing with complex mathematical calculus, numerical errors can be carried from one operation to the next and after several steps, the error may significantly increase obtaining a non-trustworthy result. Normally, in these situations, the error is generated by the representation precision limit that truncates those numbers that do not fit in the representation precision generating errors without at least keeping track of the magnitude of the error. When this is the case, the real result is equal to the obtained approximated result plus the error (which is unknown).

Another major problem when dealing with real numbers is the representation of the irrational number as the number π or e<sup>π</sup>, they are not handled by the native number data types causing limitations when calculations are based on those numbers. Normally we define a truncation of those numbers that are good enough for our purposes, but many times, the needed precision depends on the operation to do and to the composition of multiple operations, therefore, we are unable to determine which is the correct precision until we run the program.

There are a lot of libraries and tools available where we can always specify the initial precision to be used for calculations but in case of problems stated above, where we do not know the precision prior to calculations, our calculations can produce wrong or inconclusive results when precision is less than required or we will use too high precision. So, there should be a tool or library which performs all these operations and controls the precision according to requirements.

### The boost::real solution
Boost::real is a real number representation data type that address the mentioned issues using range arithmetic [1] and defining the precision as dynamical to be determined in run-time. The main goal of this data type is to represent a real number x as a program that returns a finite or infinite set of intervals containing the number x x(k) = [m<sub>k</sub> - e<sub>k</sub>, m<sub>k</sub> + e<sub>k</sub>], K ∈ N ≥ 0, e<sub>k</sub> ≥ 0. Where K1 < K2 ⇒ |x(k2)| < |x(k1)|. For this purposes, any Boost::real number has a precision const iterator that iterates over the series of intervals representing the number. The size of intervals within the series are sorted from larger to smaller, thus, each time the iterator is increased, the number precision increases due the new calculated interval is smaller than the previous one until the interval is the number itself (if possible).

Also, to allow representing irrational numbers as π or e<sup>π</sup>, boost::real has a constructor that takes as parameter a function pointer, functor (function object with the operator ()) or lambda expression that for any integer n > 0, the function returns the n-th digit of the represented number. For example, the number 1/3 can easily be represented by a program that for any input n > 0, the function returns 3.

Although it may seem that it is similar to several range/interval arithmetic libraries like boost::interval arithmetic but goals and features of this library are much more different. We provide a data type which can represent all computable real numbers, and the goal is to evaluate the expression whose required precision for evaluation is unknown in advance. The implementation of interval arithmetic comes because every number is represented as a function which returns an interval containing that number, and interval keeps on getting more precise and close to number as we increase the precision of number. In abstract, this is not an pure interval arithmetic library, the goal of this library, which is described above will keep on getting clear as you dive more into library, is to represent numbers using intervals and adjust the precision according to requirement of calculations.

## The boost::real numbers representation
In boost::real, a number has one of the next three representations:

1. Explicit number: A number is a vector of digits sorted as in the number natural representation. To determine where the integer part ends and the fractional part starts, an integer is used as the exponent of a floating point number and determines where the integer part start and the fractional ends. Also a boolean is used to set the number as positive (True) or negative (False)
2. Algorithmic number: This representation is equal to the Explicit number but instead of using a vector of digits, a lambda function must be provided. The lambda function takes an unsigned integer "n" as parameter and returns the n-th digit of the number.
3. Operation number: A number is a composition of two numbers related by an operator (+, -, *), the number creates pointers to the operands and each time the number is used, the operation is evaluated to return the result.
4. Integer number: Specific data type for integer type numbers. The use and benefit of this specified type will be explained later.
5. Rational number: Specific data type to represent rational numbers (in a/b form). It also has some representational and performance benefits which will be explained later, after general structure and working of library is explained.

Because of the third representation type, a number resulting from a complex calculus is a binary tree where each internal vertex is an operation and the vertex children are its operands. The tree leaves are those numbers represented by either (1) or (2) or (4) or (5) while the internal vertex are those numbers represented by (3). More information about the used number representation can be found in [3]
#### Use of specialized types for integer and rational numbers:
1. They do not create an operation tree or real::operation number when we do any operation between two integer or rational numbers. So, repetitive calculations involving integer and rational number, user should user these specific types so no complex tree is generated. Any operation between two rational or integer numbers will be simply a rational or integer number which is resultant to those two. As at every precision integers are same, there is no need to make precision iterations for those calculations. So, **user should use integer and rational number for small repetitive calculations to optimize space and reduce complexity but should not use them for very large and complex calculations because they do whole calculation in one go so it may become unnecessary complex expressions to do calculations at full precision when a small precision can give results.**
2. Some rational numbers can not be represented by a simple string, like 1/3, so we can represent them using this data type. They can be represented as a real operation number between two explicit numbers also.

## The boost::real precision iterator.
The boost::real::const_precision_iterator is a forward iterator [4] that iterates through the number interval precisions. The iterator returns two numbers, a lower and an upper boundary that represent the [m<sub>k</sub> - e<sub>k</sub>, m<sub>k</sub> + e<sub>k</sub>] limits of the number approximation interval for a given precision. Each time the iterator is incremented, the interval approximation_interval is decreased and a new interval with a better precision is obtained. Normally, there is no need to interact with the precision iterator and it is used by the boost::real operators <<, < and >.

> (3) Modifies the number to use the third representation. and sets copies of *this and x respectively as the left and right operands and sets multiplication as the operation.
>
> (4) Creates a new boost::real number using the third representation. For this purpose, the operator creates copies of *this and x to use as the new real number operands and defines the addition as the operation.
>
> (5) Creates a new boost::real number using the third representation. For this purpose, the operator creates copies of *this and x to use as the new real number operands and defines the subtraction as the operation.

In other case, it will throw a boost::real::precision_exception.
>

This operator creates two precision iterators (one for each number) and iterates until the number intervals stop overlapping when that happens, it compares the intervals boundaries to determine if *this is less than x. **WARNING:** If *this is equal to x, then the intervals will always overlap, because of this, and if the numbers intervals still overlap once the maximum_precision is reached, the operator throws a boost::real::precision_exception.
>
> (11) Creates a const_precision_iterator to print the number using the iterator << operator.
>
> (12) Returns the n-th digit of the represented number. **WARNING:** This operator throws invalid_representation_exception for the third representation because only explicit and algorithmic numbers can be asked for the n-th digit.

### Other methods

    1. boost::real::const_precision_iterator boost::real::cbegin()
    2. boost::real::const_precision_iterator boost::real::cend()
    3. unsigned int boost::real::maximum_precision()
    4. void boost::real::set_maximum_precision(unsigned int)

### Some Functions
    1. boost::real power(boost::real number, boost::real power)
    2. boost::real sqrt(boost::real number)
    3. boost::real exp(boost::real number)
    4. boost::real log(boost::real number)
    5. boost::real sin(boost::real number)
    6. boost::real cos(boost::real number)
    7. boost::real tan(boost::real number)
    8. boost::real sec(boost::real number)
    9. boost::real cosec(boost::real number)
    10.boost::real cot(boost::real number) 
>(1) **Power function (<i> a<sup>b</sup></i> )** 
> Takes number and power as input and returns number <sup> power </sup> as output. Fractional power of a negative number is not supported, as the result is a imaginary number (of form a+ib) and imaginary numbers are not supported in the library. The function will throw "non_integral_power_of_negative_number" exception.
>
>(2) **Square Root function**
> This functions returns square root of the number, number<sup> 1/2</sup>. Here also, if we feed a negative number, the functions throws an error. As the square root is basically number raised to power 0.5, which is an fractional power so if the number is negative, then the result would be an imaginary number. If negative number is fed to functions, it throws "sqrt_not_defined_for_negative_number" error.
>
>(3) **Exponent function (<i> e<sup>x</sup></i> )**
> Gives exponent of the number fed or return <i> e<sup>number</sup></i>.
>
>(4) **Logarithmic function**
> Return <i>log<sub>e</sub>(number)</i>. The <i>logarithm</i> only supports positive number or we can say non negative number (-&#8734;, 0] are out of domain, so if a non negative number is fed then function throws "logarithm_not_defined_for_non_positive_number" error.
>
>(5) - (10) **Trigonometric functions**
> These are trigonometric functions, and their name corresponds to the trigonometric function which they represent. 
> **Note:** There can be some scenarios where we are not able to ensure whether the number is within domain of trigonometric function or not. Like π/2 is out of domain of tan(x), and if the interval generated by the input number is [π/2 - e, π/2 +e] then we can't out put any result because the result could be anything between -&#8734; to +&#8734;, so we will iterate for more accurate input or more precise interval. We keep on iterating for more precise input until we don't have any such points(points which are out of domain) inside interval, and if we reach maximum precision and still don't get such intervals then we throw error saying number is not inside domain of trigonometric functions.
> 
> Also, a lot of times when the interval generated by input is too large then sin and cos will give [-1, 1] as output as the input is bigger than interval or contains both 1 and -1.

### Constructors
    1. boost::real::const_precision_iterator()
    2. boost::real::const_precision_iterator(real const* x)
    3. boost::real::const_precision_iterator(const boost::real::const_precision_iterator& x)
    
> (1) ** Default constructor **
> Create an empty iterator that does not point any number and thus, cannot yet be iterated.
>
> (2) Creates an iterator that points to the x number and iterates the number precision. If the number is deleted, the iterator behaviour is undefined.
>
> (3) ** Copy constructor ** 
> Creates an iterator that points the same number than the x iterator does and is initialized in the same precision that x.

    1. void operator++()
    2. bool operator==(const boost::real::real::const_precision_iterator& other)

> (1) Increases the pointer to the next precision interval of the pointed number. If the pointed number is represented by a real_explicit number and the full number precision is reached, then the operator has no effect because the number approximation lower and upper boundaries are equals and the number interval is the number itself.
>
> (2) It compare by value equality; two boost::real::real::const_precision_iterators are equals if they are pointing to the same real number and are in the same precision iteration.
>

    boost::real::real c = "0.999999"_r;
    boost::real::real d = "0.999999"_r;
    boost::real::real e = c + d;

    std::cout << "d: " << d << std::endl;

    for (auto it = e.get_real_itr().cbegin(); it != e.get_real_itr().cend(); ++it) {
        std::cout << "e iteration " << it.get_interval() << std::endl;
    }

    boost::real::real g = "0.999998"_r;

    if (g < d) {
        std::cout << "g < d --> true" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "g < d --> false" << std::endl;
    }

    boost::real::real h = d - g;

    std::cout << "d: " << d << std::endl;
    std::cout << "g: " << g << std::endl;
    std::cout << "h: " << h << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <real/real.hpp>

int main(){
    boost::real::real a("4/5", boost::real::TYPE::RATIONAL);
    boost::real::real b("5", "integer");
    boost::real::real c = a * b; 
    std::cout<<"(4/5)*5 = "<<c<<std::endl;

    a = "10"_integer;
    b = "20"_rational;
    c = b/a;
    std::cout<<"20/10 = "<<c<<std::endl; 
    return 0;
}

#include <real/real.hpp>

using real = boost::real::real<int>;
using type = boost::real::TYPE;

int main(){
    real a("2", type::INTEGER); // declared as integer data type
    real b("2"); // declare as real explicit number
    real c = real::power(a, b);
    std::cout<<"2^2 = "<<c<<std::endl;    

    c = real::sqrt(a);

### Example 5: Some exception handling
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <real/real.hpp>
#include <real/irrationals.hpp>

using real = boost::real::real<int>;
using type = boost::real::TYPE;

int main(){
    real x("-1");
    // trying to find log of x and checking whether it throws error or not
    try{
        real y = real::log(x);
    }catch(const boost::real::logarithm_not_defined_for_non_positive_number& e1){
        std::cout<<"Caught log not defined for non positive number error."<<std::endl;
    }

    // out of domain number for trigonometric functions
    x = real("0");
    try{
        real y = real::cosec(x);
    }catch(const boost::real::max_precision_for_trigonometric_function_error& e1){
        std::cout<<"Caught number out of domain of trigonometric functions error"<<std::endl;
    }

    // Non integral power of a negative number
    x = real("-4");
    real y("1.5");
    try{
        real z = real::power(x, y);
    }catch(const boost::real::non_integral_power_of_negative_number& e1){
        std::cout<<"Caught power of non integral power of negative number exception."<<std::endl;
    }

    // Square root of a negative number
    try{
        real z = real::sqrt(x);
    }catch(const boost::real::sqrt_not_defined_for_negative_number& e1){
        std::cout<<"Caught square root for negative number not supported exception."<<std::endl;
    }

}
```

### Output
```cpp
Caught log not defined for non positive number error.
Caught number out of domain of trigonometric functions error
Caught power of non integral power of negative number exception.
Caught square root for negative number not supported exception.
